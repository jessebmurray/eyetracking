# Eyetracking

The data files are available for download at [this dropbox folder](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/4au2fky38gojrwj/AABITum8SzHVav1GUNYWgq7pa?dl=0).

**If you would like to work with the letter sequence data do the following:**
1. Download the letter sequence database [seq_data.db](seq_data.db)
2. Download the letter sequence code [letter_seq_work.ipynb](letter_seq_work.ipynb) where most of the analysis is.

(The letter sequence code runs on the letter sequence database.)

**In case it is useful:** <br/>
The main Jupyter Notebook where the coordinate, questionnaire, and recording data is cleaned, integrated, and analyzed a little bit is [par_data_total](https://github.com/jessebmurray/eyetracking/blob/master/par_data_total.ipynb).
